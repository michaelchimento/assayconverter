install package by running in terminal:

python [...]/setup.py install
or
python3 [...]/setup.py install

run main.py in idle

run convert_assay(path)

path should be a string of the path for the folder which contains the .txt scripts to be converted
the data will be converted into a singular csv file, which can then be used for analysis
csv should be saved to desktop, if on a mac at least
unfortunately there is an extra column in the csv which probably should get deleted before passing it on
will fix later
